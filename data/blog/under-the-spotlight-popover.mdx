A Popover component is an overlay containing rich content. It's positioned relatively to interactive trigger element. It appears when the trigger is clicked.

At a glance, building a custom Popover may seem trivial. But there are many cases to consider. Such as accessibility concerns, collision-aware positioning and focus trapping. Because of this complexity, custom-built Popovers components leave a lot to be desired.

This article highlights how we overcame all the challenges presented when building a world-class Popover component.

## A closer look

Our goal is to ensure the Popover component adheres to the [WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#dialog_modal) while providing the best possible developer and user experiences.

Below is a list of all the features we've built into our Popover, they all work out of the box.

### Screen reader

A screen reader is a software that interprets things on the screen and converts them to a format that visually impaired people can consume and interact with.

Our Tooltip component follows the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#dialog_modal) authoring specification. This ensures it's accessible to screen reader users.

Every Radix Primitive works with screen readers. One less thing for you to worry about.

### Keyboard navigation

Keyboard navigation helps users with motor disabilities navigate across the items in the Accordion. Blind users rely on keyboard for navigation. It also improves the experience for people without disabilities.

Every Radix Primitive supports keyboard accessibility. So you can do anything you need without using your mouse.

<KeyboardTable
  data={[
    {
      keys: ['Space'],
      description: 'Opens/closes the popover.',
    },
    {
      keys: ['Enter'],
      description: 'Opens/closes the popover.',
    },
    {
      keys: ['Tab'],
      description: 'Moves focus to the next focusable element',
    },
    {
      keys: ['Shift + Tab'],
      description: 'Moves focus to the previous focusable element',
    },
    {
      keys: ['Esc'],
      description:
        'Closes the popover and moves focus to Popover Trigger',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Configurable

The Radix Popover offers common configuration options via props.

For example, you can configure it so it appears on above or below the trigger, as well as to the left or right of it. You choose the alignment of the tooltip against the trigger. You can configure its offsets, collision tollerance, whether the outside scroll is enabled or disabed, and much more.

### Positioning

When you open the Popover, it'll be positioned relatively to the trigger element. In the event where there's not enough space (a collision), the position will be adjusted.

For example, if you have configured the Popover to appear above the trigger, and there's not enough space to fully display the Popover, it'll appear below instead.

### Customisable

Built with customisation in mind, you have full control over the Tooltip's look and feel. You can also control some of its behaviour, such displaying the tooltip from a disabled trigger.

You can shape it to fit your product's needs.

### Animation

The ability add animation is essential. The Radix Tooltip has been built with animation support in mind. You can animate with CSS or with an animation library, such as Framer Motion.

Our Tooltip component exposes its transform origin via a CSS Custom Property. This enables you to add origin-aware animation in an elegant manner.
